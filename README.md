# touretteSyndromeTheGame
A game for school project... Or not -_-... Depends on if they will let me :(

Code - me.
Drawings - me.
Hours of pain - also me.

Powerpoint - We all.
Constructor - My teammates.

Special thanks - To my teammates (won't say names :(   ).

INSTRUCTIONS :
For every tick there its own cure. Give the right cure to the student and don't let them wait for too long. Good luck.
